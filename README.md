# Noita-Tools
These are some tools and scripts I have created for the Early-Access Roguelike, Noita by Nolla Games.
Please feel free to use them and let me know if you have any questions.

There is an option to automatically launch the game after a restore. To enable it set FASTMODE to true at the start of the script.

I was inspired to start this after seeing this post on reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/noita/comments/da5pwb/scripts_to_backuprestore_your_saves/
