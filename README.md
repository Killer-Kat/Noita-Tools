# Noita-Tools
These are some tools and scripts I have created for the Early-Access Roguelike, Noita by Nolla Games.
Please feel free to use them and let me know if you have any questions.

Readme for Save Tool:
There is an option to automatically launch the game after a restore. To enable it set FASTMODE to true at the start of the script.
There are 3 different save slots you can select, be aware that your selection is not saved when the script is closed.

I was inspired to start this after seeing this post on reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/noita/comments/da5pwb/scripts_to_backuprestore_your_saves/
I am not affiliated with Nolla games and these tools are free and open source for any non-commercial use.
